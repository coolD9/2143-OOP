### What to turn in:

- To get a maximum score of 80, you can do the following:
  - Create a folder in your assignments folder called OOP_Primer
  - In that folder create a file called README.md
  - Each definition will be a section in your document and should include images and especially code examples when appropriate.
  - Place your definitions in a file similar to [THIS](https://github.com/rugbyprof/2143-Object-Oriented-Programming/blob/master/Assignments/04-A04/example.md)
  - Help can be found in the resources below.
 
- To get a shot at full credit (100), you do the following:
  - Create a wiki for your OOP primer.
  - Each definition will be a page in your wiki to include images and especially code examples when appropriate.
  - Wikis are automatically a part of every repo and use the same markdown to create pages in them.
  - They simply add the ability to add additional organizing features (headers, footers, sidebar menus,etc.)
  - You can even turn your a repo or wiki into a website using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) (not necessary for assignment).
